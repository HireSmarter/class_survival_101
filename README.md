# Files for Survival 101 Classes

#### by Pasha Roberts

### Demo code supporting various presentations and classes about Prediction with Survival Analytics, including:

- Predictive Analytics World 2017 ["How to Use Survival Analytics to Predict Employee Turnover"](http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/workforce/2017/agenda_overview.php)
- UC Irvine course ["Predictive HR and Workforce Analytics"](https://ce.uci.edu/courses/sectiondetail.aspx?year=2016&term=Fall&sid=00500)

The course slides for PAW Workforce are now online in this repository.
They are HTML slides produced with [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) - if you clone this repository and open [slides/pawfw2017.html](slides/pawfw2017.html) in a browser, then you'll see a powerpoint-like presentation in your browser.
Type "?" to get the list of commands that you can use while walking through the slides.

You can also view the paw slides directly in [slides/pawfw2017.md](slides/pawfw2017.md) - though they are not as pretty.

The PAW code is in [code/survival101.R](code/survival101.R).
