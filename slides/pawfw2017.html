- attr is one of the central probs of wf ana
  - also applies in other industries like customer churn - 3 in business
  - in most industries the prob is too much, though in some it's not enough
  - huge cost and source of uncertainty for bus
  - worthy of a good predictive solution
- explore the dual nature of attrition
- look at how analytics handles the problem
  - particularly survival methods vs logistic
- will get into technical implementation detail at end
- code is on github - dl

# Who is Talent Analytics?

.float-right30[![ta](../images/ta_logo.jpg)]

### Predictive Modeling Platform – Advisor™

- We predict employee attrition and performance pre-hire.
<br/><br/>
- Much like credit risk modeling:
  - Predict likelihood to pay / default on mortgage, **before** extending credit
  - Predict likelihood to perform / leave role or company early, **before** extending job offer
<br/><br/>
- PAAS (Prediction As A Service)
- Seamless deployment of predictions into talent acquisition process

???
- little predictive dots to recruiters
- So, survival is an important part of what we're tasked to do
- R and the math aren't proprietary - let's share the approach

# Two Different (But Related) Things

.float-right[![](../images/base_spans_p12.png)]

<br/>
<br/>
- **Turnover**: Percent of employees that terminate within a period of time
- **Tenure**: Employees’ length of time working at a role or company
<br/>
<br/>
.center[### Is it a Wave or a Particle?]

???
- the answer is that we need to consider both as a whole
- don't talk to me yet about quality of employee
- right now just trying to get a mathematical hold of attrition

- That faithful rep with 30 years tenure? When?
<br/><br/>
- “The future is censored from our view”

- Wouldn't be a problem in retrospect - everyone has terminated
- Unknown term of current emps is a big problem, in practice
<br/><br/>

# Each Side Has Missing Information

### Turnover Has No Information About Tenure

- Treats a temp the **same** as a seasoned veteran
- Ignores patterns - such as people quitting right after a bonus

### Tenure Has No Information About Turnover

- High Tenure = staying power or retirement risk?

### Each Side Varies Depending on When You Look

# Hazard Rate:<br/>Conditional Daily Risk of Termination

.float-right[![](../images/base_hazard_p13.png)]

- Every day in tenure there is a (small) probability that the employee will terminate
- **Conditional on survival to the prior day**

- Like an actuarial life table
- Can rise at different times:<br/>e.g. training, review or bonus time

# Survival Rate: Daily Probability<br/>of Being Employed at Time *t*

- Near 100% on Day 1<br/>(some people actually never show up)
- Downhill from there - usually not linear
- One role at a time

<br/><br/>
- *This* is the full picture

- Simple transformation of the Hazard Curve
  - Best to use statistical tool (R, SAS)
  - Apparently possible in Excel

# Don't Use Logistic Methods<br/>to Predict Attrition!

.float-right30[![](../images/no_circle.png)]

#### Commonly Done:
- Predict one-year attrition with logistic
- Use tenure as a variable along with others

#### Common Result:
- “The biggest cause of termination is tenure”
  - Not an actionable coefficient
- Ignores nuances available to survival methods
- Mishandles current employee tenure
- Less accurate

???
- what do you do?
  - hire people with less tenure?
  - terminate people with tenure so they don't terminate?
<br/> <br/>
- Ignores time window effects
- Arbitrary 1-year - what if cliff?
- mishandles current employees' unknown termination
<br/> <br/>
- Sometimes you only care about one year mark
- the gods of statistics do not approve

---

# Proportional Hazard

.float-right[![](../images/surv_thresholds_p12.png)]

#### Most Survival models are “Proportional Hazard”
- Start with Base Survival rate
- Convert to Base Cumulative Hazard rate
<br/><br/>
- Multiply Cumulative Hazard by a single factor<br/>(hence “Proportional Hazard")
<br/><br/>
- Linear changes to Hazard lead<br/>to a *rotation* of Survival Curve

#### .highlight[Predictive Goal:]<br/>Predict the amount of Survival Curve<br/>rotation for each candidate

???
- inverse log relationship

---

# Proportional Hazard Prediction Methods

.float-right[![](../images/lasso.png)]

#### Predicting a Single Number
- Cox regression
  - Vanilla Cox
  - Stepwise
  - ElasticNet or LASSO
  - Variable selection with Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks
- SVM, etc

#### There are also other survival algorithms,<br/>including parametric methods

# Formulas and Jargon

**Hazard Function:**  &nbsp;&nbsp; `\(h(t)\)`
- Probability of termination at time *t*, conditional on survival up to time t
- Ranges from 0 to 1 (typically very small)

**Cumulative Hazard Function:** &nbsp; `\(H(t) = \int_0^t \! h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = -log(S(t))\)`
- Cumulative conditional probability of termination up to time *t*
- Ranges from 0 to 4ish (theoretically to Infinity)

**Survival Function:** &nbsp;&nbsp; `\(S(t) = e^{-H(t)}\)`
- Probability that termination will be later than time *t*
- Ranges from 1 to 0

#### Theoretically the formulas above are continuous measures, but in practice are discrete daily.

???
- H is sometimes lambda, which is overused IMO
- vectors, not single numbers
- formulas are all the same

# Calculating Survival in R

### Four Simple Steps with R `survival` package:

1. Gather and Prepare the Data
2. Calculate Baseline Survival Function `\(S_0(t)\)`
3. Model Proportional Hazard with Cox Regression
4. Validate Model
--

<br/><br/>
5. Deploy Model into hiring
6. Hire people likely to stay on the job longer
7. Save and earn money
  - Avoid attributing savings to soft factors like ripple effect, morale, engagement
  - Hard savings from reduced Replacement Cost
  - Hard earnings from increased Employee Lifetime Value

---

# 1) Gather Employee Data

```r
> attr.data

  emp.id  hire.date  term.date   factor.x  factor.y factor.z
   <int>     <dttm>     <dttm>      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
1     52 2016-02-23       <NA> 0.09555369  1.515028 102.3811
2    261 2014-10-30       <NA> 2.40144024  9.065855 100.5727
*3    193 2013-12-25 2015-03-28 1.88463382  4.331642 105.6887
*4    150 2013-03-27 2013-09-19 3.81625316  7.363454 110.6842
5     31 2015-03-25       <NA> 5.17392728 11.824601 110.0590
```

#### Simple Requirements

- Just `hire.date` and `term.date` is all you need from HRIS
  - Leave `term.date` as `NA` if the employee haven't terminated yet
<br/><br/>
- Merge with predictive input (independent) variables
  - e.g. assessment results, experience, CV detail, social media, semantic
  - Here we use `factor.x`, `factor.y` and `factor.z`
  - Are these variables available pre-hire?

???
- highlighted actual terminations - note NA term.date
- funny things with rehire, transfers
- one role at a time

---

# Calculate Fields for Survival

```r
> attr.data %>% dplyr::select(-dplyr::contains("factor"))

  emp.id  hire.date  term.date is.term   end.date tenure.years
   <int>     <dttm>     <dttm>   <lgl>     <dttm>        <dbl>
1     52 2016-02-23       <NA>   FALSE 2017-05-01    1.1854894
2    261 2014-10-30       <NA>   FALSE 2017-05-01    2.5023956
*3    193 2013-12-25 2015-03-28    TRUE 2015-03-28    1.2539357
*4    150 2013-03-27 2013-09-19    TRUE 2013-09-19    0.4818617
5     31 2015-03-25       <NA>   FALSE 2017-05-01    2.1026694
```

#### Simple Derivations

- `is.term`: Have they terminated?  Is `term.date` NA?
- `end.date`: Either `term.date`, or censor date, depending on `is.term`
  - Could put `transfer.date` here with no `is.term`
  - *The last date we know the employee was at work*
- `tenure.years`: What is employee tenure from `hire.date` to `end.date`?
  - *All we know about the employee's tenure, as of censor date*


???
- survival wants a time variable and a event variable
- highlighted actual terminations - note censored end.date
- In practice, job.tenure, hire.tenure, location.tenure
- See code for detail

# 2) Calculate Baseline Survival (`\(S_0(t)\)`)

#### `survival::Surv` is a single object to hold Tenure and Turnover at once

```r
*> surv.obj <- survival::Surv(training.data$tenure.years, training.data$is.term)
```

- Needs “time variable” `tenure.years` and “event variable” `is.term`

#### `survival::survfit` is the Kaplan-Meier Estimator of `\(S_0(t)\)`

```r
*> surv.fit <- survival::survfit(surv.obj ~ 1)
> summary(surv.fit)
Call: survfit(formula = surv.obj ~ 1)

  time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI
 0.000    320       1    0.997 0.00312        0.991        1.000
 0.249    308       1    0.994 0.00448        0.985        1.000

# 3) Back to Proportional Hazard

.float-right[![](../images/surv_thresholds_p12.png)]

#### Consider a multiplier *x* that centers on 1
- Multiply `\(H_x(t) = H_0(t) x \)`<br/>for proportional (linear) changes to Hazard
- Survival Curve **rotates** in response: `\(S_x(t) = e^{-H_0(t) x} \)`

#### Beware - inverse relationship:
- .red-text[*x* ← 1.1]  will increase `\(H_x(t)\)`, decrease `\(S_x(t)\)`
- .blue-text[*x* ← 0.9] will decrease `\(H_x(t)\)`, increase `\(S_x(t)\)`

#### So we just need to predict *x* to predict Survival
- One number drives the entire curve, based on baseline `\(H_0(t)\)`

???

---

# Model Proportional Hazard<br/>with Cox Regression

```r
*> cox.model <- survival::coxph(formula = surv.obj ~ scale.x + scale.y + scale.z,
*                              data = training.data)

> cox.model

Call:
survival::coxph(formula = surv.obj ~ scale.x + scale.y + scale.z,
    data = training.data)

           coef exp(coef) se(coef)     z         p
*scale.x -0.4298    0.6506   0.0918 -4.68 0.0000028
*scale.y -0.3204    0.7258   0.0957 -3.35   0.00082
*scale.z -0.1967    0.8215   0.0984 -2.00   0.04558

Likelihood ratio test=38.2  on 3 df, p=0.000000025
n= 320, number of events= 125
```

???
- all the factors are predicting HAZARD not survival.
- negative coeff, so
  - more scale.x -> less hazard -> more survival
<br/><br/>
- twisty maze of logarithms and inversions
- for all this talk we've only run 3 lines of code

---

# 4) Predict `validation.data`<br/>with New Cox Model

```r
*> cox.pred <- predict(cox.model, newdata = validation.data, type = "lp")
```

- .highlight[Note:] we built model with `training.data`, now we predict against `validation.data`
  - Our model has never seen anything in `validation.data`
  - Great test to see how closely our predictions match known outcomes
<br/><br/>
- The `predict.coxph()` function returns 5 different types of predictions
  - We want `type = "lp"` which is `log(multiplier)` to baseline `\(H_0(t)\)`
  - Other types won't work with `survivalROC()`

---

# How does ROC Work with Survival?

```r
*> roc.obj <- survivalROC::survivalROC(Stime = validation.data$tenure.years,
*                                    status = validation.data$is.term,
*                                    marker = cox.pred,
*                                    predict.time = 1,
*                                    lambda = 0.003)

> roc.obj$AUC
[1] 0.7102442
```

#### ROC typically evaluates classification methods
- So, we make this a classification problem
- **Classify:** Was the employee terminated at `t = 1` or not?
- Compare actual vs. predicted classifications at all cutpoints

#### Our AUC is 0.71
- Not bad for a censored attrition prediction!

???
- Can make a lot of money with a 0.71 millions
- Get nervous if AUC is too high
<br/><br/>
- Poorly written but accurate
- now up to 5 lines of code

---

# Plot AUC with `ggplot2`

![](../images/auc_p21.png)

???
- Different regions have different costs
- can transform this to
  - cost-weighted AUC
  - area under highlighted region

---

# Don't Get Fooled by Randomness

### We are predicting AUC, too

- Let's try predicting 1000 random samples of the same underlying pattern

```r
> test.repl <- replicate(1000, demoPrediction(verbose = FALSE))

> summary(test.repl)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
 0.3470  0.6191  0.6833  0.6771  0.7356  0.9446
```

- AUC generally fell between 0.619 and 0.735, but 50% were outside this range
- The likely AUC is closer to 0.68 - still good
- What if you got a **lucky** (or unlucky) 80/20 validation split?

???
- Our first AUC of 0.71 was a bit higher than what is likely
